# SAF Toolbox

## Description

The SAF Toolbox provides a MATLAB implementation of the basic functions of the novel nonlinear Spline Adaptive Filter (SAF), introduced in the recent works of the authors. This kind of adaptive filter derives from the general family of block-oriented nonlinear architectures.

In addition, some scripts implementing a number of demo extracted from the experimental results of the related literature, were provided. The aims of these demo files is to show how the library functions can be used in practical implementations.

## The Latest Version

The latest version of the toolbox can be downloaded on GitHub at the following link:
